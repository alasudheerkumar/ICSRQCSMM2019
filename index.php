<h2 class="text-info">Scope</h2>

	* Reliability Analysis is essentially a performance evaluation strategy starting from product development
	 to complex systems. Designing for reliability is of prime concern with any fields of Engineering, Technology,
	 Sciences and Management. Moreover, predictive assessment of systems will make the entrepreneurs to improve the
	 quality of products so as to reduce the failure rateof the components.<br /> 
	* In this context, the following areas are identified in the following Engineering disciplines where in the college
	JNTUA CEA is offering.<br />
	i) Computer Science & Engineering (CSE)<br />
	ii) Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE)<br /> 
	iii) Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE)<br /> 
	iv) Mechanical Engineering (ME)<br />v) Civil Engineering (CE)<br />
	vi) Chemical Engineering (ChE) <br /><br /><br />
